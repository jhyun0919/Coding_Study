With the exception of Program P13-04 and P13-05, the programs in this chapter 
run without modification as presented in the text. Note that some programs 
in the text, such as programs 3 and 4, have been combined. Programs 11 and 
13 are not included because they are pseudocode.

You will need to make sure that the input files are in the correct
directory/folder. You should also check to make sure the path is correct
for these files. Some of the programs on the solutions disk may have been
modified to check for a successful file opening.

1.	P13-01.c 	Read file of integers
2.	P13-02/3.c	Read student file and Write structured data
3.	P13-04.c	Append two binary files
				We added a statement to seek end of file.
				
				We have included a program to create binary files.
				See below.
4.	P13-05.c	Text to binary student file
				In getData (line 72, page 676), remove dereference of
				ioResult so that it reads:
					if (ioResult)
5.	P13-06.c	Print student data
6.	P13-07ff.c	Random file application
7.	P13-11 		Pseudocode for merging (not included)
8.	P13-12.c	Merge two files
9.	P13-13 		Pseudocode for file update (not included)

The following files are also available on the solutions disk. You will have
to recreate the binary files for your hardware system. We have provided
two program to help.
	 1.	P13-stu.txt	Student text file.
	 2.	P13MkBin.c	Make binary files of integers.
	 3.	P13MkMrg.c	Make binary files for merge.
