Some of the bit variables in these programs were changed to short
to accomodate systems with 32 bit integer lengths. 

For some systems, problem 3 has been modified to add an fseek
command to support the Borland compiler.

Otherwise, the programs in this chapter run without modification runs 
as presented in the text. 

1.	P15-01.C 	Simple bitwise and demonstration
2.	P15-02.C 	Simple inclusive or demonstration
3.	P15-03.C 	Simple exclusive or demonstration
4.	P15-04.C 	One's complement
5.	P15-05.C 	Simple shift left demonstration
6.	P15-06.C 	Simple shift right demonstration
7.	P15-07.C 	Convert words to uppercase
8.	P15-08.C 	Convert words to lowercase
9.	P15-09.C 	Reverse case of words
10.	P15-10.C 	Print binary number revisited
11.	P15-11.C 	Rotate right function

??????The following binary files are required for this chapter. Note that you may need to recreate them for your hardware system.
	 1.	int_evens.bin
	 2.	int_odds.bin
