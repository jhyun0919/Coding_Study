The programs in this chapter run without modification runs as presented
in the text. Programs 4 through 11 have been combined into one program (#4).
Note that one function, findMinimum, was accidently deleted from the text.
It is reproduced below for your information. (It is included in the solutions
disk.)

/*	================== rowMinimum ================== */
/* This function calculates the minimum of the data in a row.
	Pre:		A pointer to the row
	Post:		Returns the minimum for that row.

int rowMinimum ( int *rowPtr )
{
/*	Prototype Declarations */
int smaller ( int first, int second ) ; 

/*	Local Declarations */
	int rowMin = INT_MAX ;
	int column ;

/*	Statements */
	for ( column = 1 ; column <= *rowPtr ; column++ ) 
		rowMin = smaller ( rowMin, *( rowPtr + column ) ) ;
