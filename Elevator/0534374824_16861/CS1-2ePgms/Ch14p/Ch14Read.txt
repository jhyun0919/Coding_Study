The programs in this chapter run without modification runs as presented
in the text. 


Programs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 12 have been combined into
<P14-LINK.H>. This header file is then used in programs 10, 11 and
13. Also included is a header file, P14-DATA.h, for the data structures. 
Finally, we have included a program, P14-TestSeq.c,  that is not in the text. 
This program tests the sequential insertion of data into the linked list.

Make sure that the files are located in the correct directory/folder and
that their paths are correct.
